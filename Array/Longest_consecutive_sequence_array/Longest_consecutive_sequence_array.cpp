-------- approach ---------------

We will do this with the help of the Set data structure.

How to identify if a number can be the starting number for a sequence:

    First, we will put all the array elements into the set data structure.
    If a number, num, is a starting number, ideally, num-1 should not exist. So, for every element, x, in the set, we will check if x-1 exists inside the set. :
       -> If x-1 exists: This means x cannot be a starting number and we will move on to the next element in the set.
       -> If x-1 does not exist: This means x is a starting number of a sequence. So, for number, x, we will start finding the consecutive elements.

How to search for consecutive elements for a number, x:

    Instead of using linear search, we will use the set data structure itself to search for the elements x+1, x+2, x+3, and so on.
    Thus, using this method we can narrow down the search and optimize the approach.

----------- Algorithm ------------

We will declare 2 variables,

    ‘cnt’ → (to store the length of the current sequence),
    ‘longest’ → (to store the maximum length).

First, we will put all the array elements into the set data structure.

For every element, x, that can be a starting number(i.e. x-1 does not exist in the set) we will do the following
        -> We will set the length of the current sequence(cnt) to 1.
        -> Then, again using the set, we will search for the consecutive elements such as x+1, x+2, and so on, and find the maximum possible 
           length of the current sequence. This length will be stored in the variable ‘cnt’.
        -> After that, we will compare ‘cnt’ and ‘longest’ and update the variable ‘longest’ with the maximum value (i.e. longest = max(longest, cnt)).

Finally, we will have the answer i.e. ‘longest’.
